# CppND-System-Monitor

My implementation for System Monitor Project in the Object Oriented Programming Course of the [Udacity C++ Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213). 

## Dependencies 

Install ncurses within your own Linux environment: 

For Debian based distributions : `sudo apt install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev`

You also need `cmake` and `make` installed 


## Make
This project uses [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/). The Makefile has four targets:
* `build` compiles the source code and generates an executable
* `format` applies [ClangFormat](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) to style the source code
* `debug` compiles the source code and generates an executable, including debugging symbols
* `clean` deletes the `build/` directory, including all of the build artifacts

## Instructions

1. Clone the project repository

2. Build the project: `make build`

3. Run the resulting executable: `./build/monitor`
